/* Polling flags that are manipulated by I/O callbacks and handshake callbacks
 * indicate what they expect from a file descriptor at each layer. For each
 * direction, we have 2 bits, one stating whether any suspected activity on the
 * FD induce a call to the iocb, and another one indicating that the FD has
 * already returned EAGAIN and that polling on it is essential before calling
 * the iocb again :
 *   POL ENA  state
 *    0   0   STOPPED : any activity on this FD is ignored
 *    0   1   ENABLED : any (suspected) activity may call the iocb
 *    1   0   STOPPED : as above
 *    1   1   POLLED  : the FD is being polled for activity
 *
 * - Enabling an I/O event consists in ORing with 1.
 * - Stopping an I/O event consists in ANDing with ~1.
 * - Polling for an I/O event consists in ORing with ~3.
 *
 * The last computed state is remembered in CO_FL_CURR_* so that differential
 * changes can be applied. After bits are applied, the POLL status bits are
 * cleared so that it is possible to detect when an EAGAIN was encountered. For
 * pollers that do not support speculative I/O, POLLED is the same as ENABLED
 * and the POL flag can safely be ignored. However it makes a difference for
 * the connection handler.
 *
 * The ENA flags are per-layer (one pair for SOCK, another one for DATA).
 * The POL flags are only for the socket layer since they indicate that EAGAIN
 * was encountered. Thus, the DATA layer uses its own ENA flag and the socket
 * layer's POL flag.
